# Complex-Calculator
A calculator function made in javascript. Basically it is a function that takes a string with calculations as input and can figure out what the mathematical result of it is. There are also some more functions that are used to help filter the input, the noSpaces function removes the spaces from the input so that the program can work a bit better and the fitler function is a function that returns true or false depending on if the input is valid or not.
